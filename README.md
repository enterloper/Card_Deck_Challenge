# Chevy_Chase_Goes_To_War
A coding challenge from a pretty cool company that wanted me to shuffle a deck of cards. That sounded kind of boring. Maybe it was supposed to be, but who likes boring?

From the boss:  *Write a simple class in the language of your choice to represent a deck of cards with operations to shuffle the deck and to deal one card.*
